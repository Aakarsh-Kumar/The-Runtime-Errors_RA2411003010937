Problem Statement:
University students often face long lines and crowded dining halls, leading to wasted time and frustration during peak hours.
This results in students either skipping meals or settling for less desirable options, which impacts their overall well-being and academic performance.

Solution: 
CampusCrave is a web app designed to streamline the dining experience for university students by eliminating wait times. Students can browse menus, place orders, and schedule pickups, receiving real-time updates on their order status. This allows them to grab their meals exactly when they’re ready, avoiding lines and saving time. CampusCrave also benefits campus dining facilities by optimizing order management and improving service efficiency, making campus life more convenient and enjoyable.
